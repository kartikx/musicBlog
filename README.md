# MusicBlog
MusicBlog is intended to be a Social Media where people can get together to share Songs that they like. Users are allowed to upload their Song Suggestions as well as comment and rate the Suggestions of their peers.

The BackEnd of this Project is written completely in Django. Parts of the application have been Serialized based on REST Principles using (Django-REST)[https://www.django-rest-framework.org/]. This allows Users to Like and Comment on posts, without forcing the Page to Reload. The BackEnd is also linked to (Spotify's Web API)[https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/], which allows for automation of Album Art and Song Genres for Posts uploaded by the user.

The FrontEnd has been written in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. I plan to refactor the FrontEnd to use React in the Future.
